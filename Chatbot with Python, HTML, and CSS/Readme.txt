A Chatbot is a computer program which is programmed to interact with a human. A chatbot is designed to reply to a human user based on their queries and conversations. I will build and deploy a very simple Artificial Intelligent Chatbot. I will use the flask method to deploy the chatbot and the chatterbot package in python to build a chatbot.Chatterbot is a Python library that generates responses for users. It uses a lot of pre-trained machine learning algorithms to give a variety of responses. Itâ€™s easy to create chatbots using the chatterbot library in Python. The chatbot should be designed to be language-independent. He must be trained in several languages. The chatbot is made up of data provided by the user.
