Simple AI Chatbot with Flask and Chatterbot

This repository contains the code for a simple Artificial Intelligent Chatbot built using Flask and the Chatterbot package in Python. The chatbot is deployed as a web application, and it utilizes HTML and CSS for the frontend. Here's a quick guide on the project:

#### Project Overview:

**Introduction:**
  In this project, a basic AI Chatbot is created and deployed using Flask for web development and the Chatterbot library in Python. The chatbot interacts with users, providing responses based on their queries and conversations.

**Technologies Used:**
  - Flask: Used for deploying the chatbot as a web application.
  - Chatterbot: A Python library that generates responses using pre-trained machine learning algorithms.

**HTML and CSS:**
  The frontend of the chatbot is built with HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface. The code for the HTML and CSS is available in the `index.html` and `style.css` files, respectively.

#### How to Deploy the Chatbot:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Flask and Chatterbot installed. You can install them using the following commands:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   pip install chatterbot
   ```

2. **Run the Flask App:**
   Execute the `app.py` file to run the Flask app and deploy the chatbot.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the Chatbot:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the deployed chatbot.

Project Structure:

- **`index.html`:**
  Contains the HTML code for the chatbot's user interface, providing a chatbox for interaction.

- **`style.css`:**
  Defines the styling for the chatbox, enhancing the user experience.

- **`app.py`:**
  The main Flask application file that integrates Chatterbot and handles user input to generate chatbot responses.

#### Additional Notes:

- Ensure you have a good understanding of Flask and HTML frameworks for successful deployment.
- The Chatterbot library is used for generating responses. Familiarize yourself with its basics for better comprehension.
